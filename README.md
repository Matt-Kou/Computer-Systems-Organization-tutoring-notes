## Useful notes

1. **Please let me know beforehand if you are coming to the tutoring session.**
1. - Update: That are several students preferring in-person meetings. That's fine with me. We can meet at the Bobst Library which I will be present everyday.

    Here is the list of the tutoring sessions (might be changed in the future to fit students need):

    - Weekdays: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm
    - Weekends: 7:30 pm - 9:00 pm

    In addition to those periods, you can always email me with your questions. If I have time, we can have a quick zoom session.

3. How to access linser1:

    If you are doing this for the first time, type `yes` and enter.

    There will then be a required authentication. choose one (e.g. for duo push, type `1` and enter).

    ```bash
    ssh linserv1
    ```
