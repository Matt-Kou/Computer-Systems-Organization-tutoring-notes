## Useful notes

1. **Please let me know beforehand if you are coming to the tutoring session. Also, as a tutor, I am not in charge of grading and other logistics.**
1. - That are several students preferring in-person meetings. That's fine with me. We can meet at the Bobst Library which I will be present everyday.

    Here is the list of the tutoring sessions (might be changed in the future to fit students need):

    - Weekdays: 11:00 am - 12:00 pm
    - Weekends: 7:30 pm - 9:00 pm

    In addition to those periods, you can always email me with your questions. If I have time, we can have a quick zoom session.

1. For Windows, you don't really need PuTTY and WinSCP since ssh and scp has been integrated in command prompt and Windows Terminal. You can follow the same process as mentioned above and in the tutorial.
